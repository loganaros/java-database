# About Me
Hello, my name is Logan and I have been tinkering with computers since the age of 5. I built my first gaming PC when I was just 13 years old, and started coding aroung that age as well. In high school, I took every computer programming and game design class that was offered, and learned so quickly that my average score in the class was 115% as my teacher would give me extra credit for teaching the other kids. I eventually joined a program called FBLA, where I competed in cybersecurity and computer programming competitions, placing 4th in state and going to nationals to compete for computer programming. My main languages are Java and C#, and OOP is where I excel the most. Since then, I have continued to teach myself over 10 different languages, including C++, Python, Ruby, Swift, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more.
